1. When I run a program, its parent process is the shell. In my case, I use the tcsh shell.
2. The parent process of that process would be launchd for me, because I am on MacOS. This is the process that manages all the other system and user processes.
3. The parent of the launchd process would be the kernel process. This starts and manages system processes when I first boot up my computer.
