1. When I run a program, its parent process is the shell. In my case, I use the tcsh shell.
2. The parent process of the shell is the init process. Since I use MacOS, I believe for me this process is actually the launchd process.
3. The parent of the init process would be "Process 0" or the kernel's process.
